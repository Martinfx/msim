Introduction MSIM

To develop an operating system from scratch is an invincible problem for most students â€“ but starting at already finished base will never disclose them what the operating systems are about.

MSIM is a light-weight computer simulator based on MIPS R4000. It is used for education and research purposes, mainly to teach the construction and implementation of operating systems. MSIM is distributed with source code under the GNU GPL license to make possible modifications for users and works on most POSIX-compliance environments (mainly GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, but can be also compiled in Cygwin or MinGW in Windows). The user interface is simple terminal-style.

MSIM provides following features (along others):

    MIPS R4000 CPU
        full memory management (TLB)
        multiprocessor support
        the instruction set is restricted to 32 bits
        CPU cache is not simulated
    simple debugging features (including disassembling, register content dump)
    several simple hardware devices
    various hardware-manipulating commands
    widely configurable memory mapping of devices
    script-like start-up configuration file

MSIM does not aim to be a speed-optimized real hardware simulator, but rather a fully deterministic simulator useful for kernel debugging. There are several other projects which aim speed-optimized simulation (e.g. GXemul), but they are more complex to use.
